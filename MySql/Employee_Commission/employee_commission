Solution:


SELECT Employees.id,Employees.Name,Employees.Salary,Departments.name
FROM Employees
JOIN Departments
ON Departments.id=Employees.Department_id;

1. SELECT Name, SUM(Commission_Amount) AS Total_Commission 
   FROM Employees JOIN Commissions 
   ON Employees.id = Commissions.Employee_id 
   GROUP BY Commissions.Employee_id 
   HAVING Total_Commission = (SELECT SUM(Commission_Amount) AS Total_Commission 
                              FROM Employees 
                              JOIN Commissions 
                              ON Employees.id = Commissions.Employee_id
                              GROUP BY Commissions.Employee_id
                              ORDER BY total_commission DESC 
                              LIMIT 1);

2. SELECT Name 
   From Employees 
   ORDER BY salary DESC 
   LIMIT 3,1;

3. SELECT d.Name, SUM(Commission_Amount) AS Total_Commission
   FROM Departments AS d 
   JOIN Employees AS e 
   JOIN Commissions AS c
   ON e.id = c.Employee_id AND d.id = e.Department_id
   GROUP BY d.id
   HAVING Total_Commission = (SELECT SUM(Commission_Amount) AS Total_Commission
                              FROM Employees AS e 
                              JOIN Commissions AS c
                              ON e.id = c.Employee_id
                              GROUP BY e.Department_id
                              ORDER BY total_commission DESC
                              LIMIT 1);

4. SELECT group_concat(Name) AS Employees, Commission_Amount 
   FROM Employees 
   LEFT JOIN Commissions
   ON Commissions.Employee_id = Employees.id
   GROUP BY Commission_Amount
   HAVING Commission_Amount > 3000;
