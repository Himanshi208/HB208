Question: Take back up of the db you created for practice/exercise and send it to me.

Now create a new database named "restored" and restore that backup into this DB.


Solution:

CREATE DATABASE database1;
sudo mysqldump -u root database1 > database1.sql
DROP database1;
CREATE DATABASE restored;
sudo mysql -u root restored < database1.sql
