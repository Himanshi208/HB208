Solution:

# Your Ruby code here
class String
  def highlight(str)
    count = 0
    highlighted_string = gsub(/(?<str>#{str})/i) do |match|
      count += 1
      '(' + match + ')'
    end
    return highlighted_string, count
  end
end
if ARGV[0].nil?
  puts 'Please provide an input'
else
  highlighted_string, count = ARGV[0].highlight(ARGV[1])
  puts highlighted_string
  puts "Total occurrences found: #{count}"
end
